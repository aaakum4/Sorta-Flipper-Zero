# Sorta-Flipper-Zero
At the cost of a flipper zero, I thought that I may never own one. Then I found a hackster.io page that went through a full DIY and cheap Flipper Zero and I thought I'd try it myself with some changes.

## Step 1 – Looking at the Flipper Zero Hardware
Before starting this project, I went through the Flipper Zero hardware documentation to understand how the device is built and what components it uses.

From this, I created the table below listing the main hardware blocks used in the Flipper Zero.
This table is used as a reference to understand the system, not something to copy directly.
